In an increasingly digital world, many designers have abandoned traditional tools. But I've found that the most powerful creative process combines the best of both analog and digital realms. Technology offers precision and endless modification, but hand-sketching provides an irreplaceable connection to raw creativity.

My design process always begins with pencil and paper. There's a tactile magic in physically drawingâ€”the resistance of the paper, the slight imperfection of hand-drawn lines, the ability to quickly explore ideas without digital constraints. These initial sketches are fluid, allowing my creativity to flow without the sometimes-restrictive nature of software interfaces.

Once I've explored initial concepts manually, I transition to digital tools. Software like Adobe Illustrator and Figma allow for precise refinement, easy iteration, and the ability to create scalable, adaptable designs. But these digital tools are always informed by those initial analog explorations. By maintaining this hybrid approach, I ensure my designs retain a sense of human touch and spontaneity, even as they achieve professional polish and precision.
