## Hello

_by Adele_

### Verse 1

Hello, it's me<br />
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet<br />
To go over everything<br />
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing<br />
Hello, can you hear me?<br />
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be<br />
When we were younger and free<br />
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet<br />

### Pre-Chorus

There's such a difference between us<br />
And a million miles

### Chorus

Hello from the other side<br />
I must've called a thousand times<br />
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done<br />
But when I call, you never seem to be home<br />
Hello from the outside<br />
At least, I can say that I've tried<br />
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br />
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

### Verse 2

Hello, how are you?<br />
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry<br />
I hope that you're well<br />
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

### Pre-Chorus

It's no secret that the both of us<br />
Are running out of time

### Chorus

So hello from the other side (Other side)<br />
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)<br />
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done<br />
But when I call, you never seem to be home<br />
Hello from the outside (outside)<br />
At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)<br />
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br />
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

### Bridge

Ooh, anymore<br />
Ooh, anymore<br />
Ooh, anymore<br />
Anymore

### Chorus

Hello from the other side (Other side)<br />
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)<br />
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done<br />
But when I call, you never seem to be home<br />
Hello from the outside (outside)<br />
At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)<br />
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br />
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
