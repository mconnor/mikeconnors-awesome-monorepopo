## Who Rescued Whom

It began with _the Husky_, a ghost from some other life, **pulled from a vacant lot** where he had been _chained to the carcass of a refrigerator_ — a **king in exile**, guarding nothing but his own shadow. He came into my rooms like _a storm that had forgotten its thunder_, pacing the floorboards with the slow suspicion of one who has been promised safety before **and found it to be a lie**.

Then came _the pair_ — **Elizabeth and Henry** — from the shelter in Brooklyn, _that grand mausoleum of the unwanted_. They were a matched set, **two halves of the same wound**. You could not take one without the other; to do so would be to break _the only law they knew_, the law of their bond.

Elizabeth, _the shepherd_, kept her eyes on all of us, **counting heads**, drawing invisible lines to hold the world together. Henry was all trembling edges and sudden starts, _a creature whose heart beat too close to the surface_. He feared cats until we brought one home — then he feared nothing, _except perhaps the moment when she would leave his side_.

They filled the rooms with their breathing, their clumsy joy, their **long slow afternoons curled into sleep**. They lived as only _the saved_ can live — _not as a gift taken for granted, but as a reprieve granted by some invisible court_. And when they went — as all things go — they left their scent in the air, their shapes in the worn places on the floor, **the ghost-weight of their bodies pressing down on memory**.

I thought I had rescued them. _That’s the trick._ You think you are the savior, the one who bends down into the pit. **But the truth is simpler and more merciless:** you are the one in the pit, _and they are the rope_.
