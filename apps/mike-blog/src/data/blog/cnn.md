## If it bleeds, and fits the narrative, it leads

A few days ago i watched CNN spin a narrative that MAGAs were ginning up a horrific murder - a hate crime - for political purposes. Yes, MAGAs and only MAGAs were shocked, angered and saddened that a mentally ill repeat offender - a large grown ass man whose mother said should not be on the street - were offended. After all a large crazy man stabbing a tiny woman to death on the train and then walking away muttering "i got that white girl" happens all the time.

3 years ago, when i moved here, a young Black kid drove to the wrong house to pick up his sister. An 80 year old man white man answered the door and shot him.

Activist were marching in the neighborhood. CNN and BBC were teasing the news hours "WHITE MAN SHOOTS BLACK BOY IN KANSAS CITY".

The police investigation had just began - no other details needed.

That story went away when within the same week there were 3 other GET OFF MY LAWN SHOOTINGS that lacked the racial narrative.

The young man who was shot has recovered. By all accounts, he's a super sweat, smart, quiet young man. And it was just awful. But looks like he's going to be ok.

But on the same day that kid was shot, there was a huge shootout at e. 35th & Prospect. And nobody gave a shit because the violence was inter-ethnic.
