# Glyptodon - Personal Astro Theme

A clean and modern, eco-friendly personal website theme built with [Astro](https://www.astro.build], using fluid type and grid sizing for smooth size transitions.

All dummy text is created by Claude AI to get a sense for what it looks like with content.

To see it in action, I use it for my own website at [www.timeaton.dev](https://www.timeaton.dev). Feel free to use and modify for your needs!

## Colors

The colors were chosen using several tools to insure accessibility and contrast. The colors are all set using variables for dark and light in the global.css file. Personally, I created the palletes and gradients using these tools:

- https://colorffy.com/color-scheme-generator
- https://www.learnui.design/tools/accessible-color-generator.html
- https://colorffy.com/mesh-gradient-generator (for the background gradient)
